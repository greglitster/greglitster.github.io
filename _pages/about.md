I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto. I work at the [Troost Institute for Leadership Education in Engineering (ILead)](https://ilead.engineering.utoronto.ca/) under the supervisor of [Dr. Emily Moore](https://ilead.engineering.utoronto.ca/people/emily-moore-director/). My reserach explores human congition during the design process. I have a particular interest in design framing - the way we think about complex problems - and my doctoral work explores the relationships between framing, collaboration, and engineering.

Prior to coming to the University of Toronto, I completed a Master of Applied Science degree in the [Management Science and Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-science-engineering/) department at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Dr. Ada Hurst](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/adahurst), where we worked to understand design framing using a systems thinking lens. I also hold a [Bachelor of Knowledge Integration](https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/) from the University of Waterloo.
