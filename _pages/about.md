I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto. I work in the [Troost Institute for Leadership Education in Engineering](https://ilead.engineering.utoronto.ca/) under the supervisor of [Dr. Emily Moore](https://ilead.engineering.utoronto.ca/people/emily-moore-director/). My reserach looks at design framing in the earliest part of the design prcoess. In particular I am interested in understnding the role of engineering and collaboration in relation to design framing, as the way we look at problems often limit what kind of solutions we can develop. 

Prior to coming to the University of Toronto for my doctoral work, I completed a Master of Applied Science in the [Management Science and Engineering Department](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-science-engineering/) at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Dr. Ada Hurst](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/adahurst). I also hold a [Bachelor of Knowledge Integration](https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/) from the University of Waterloo.
